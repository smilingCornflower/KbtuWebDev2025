<p>
    The <strong>cheetah</strong> (<em>Acinonyx jubatus</em>) is a unique member of the feline family, renowned for its
    <strong>extraordinary speed</strong>. These predators primarily inhabit the <em>savannas</em> and open plains of
    Africa.
</p>
<p>
    Cheetahs are known for their <strong>slim, aerodynamic body structure</strong>, long legs, and a deep chest, all of
    which make them the fastest land animals. They can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph (97 km/h) in just a few seconds.
</p>
<p>
    Unlike other big cats, cheetahs cannot roar but communicate through <em>chirps</em>, growls, and purrs. They use
    their <strong>keen eyesight</strong> to hunt and rely on stealth to catch prey like <em>gazelles</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Despite their impressive speed, cheetahs face <strong>serious threats</strong> such as habitat loss, human-wildlife
    conflict, and competition with larger predators. Conservation is vital to protect this <em>amazing species</em>.
