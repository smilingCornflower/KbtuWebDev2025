What is the correct syntax for adding a comment in HTML?
    <!-- This is a comment -->

Use the HTML comment tag to make a comment out of the "This is a comment" text.
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <!-- This is a comment -->
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

Add comment tags around the paragraph:
    <!-- <p>This is a paragraph.</p> -->
